        <name>tower defense</name>
        <description>tower defense is a subgenre of real-time strategy video games. the goal of tower defense games is to try to stop enemies from crossing a map by building traps to slow them down and towers which shoot at them as they pass. enemies and towers usually have varied abilities, costs, and upgrade prices. when an enemy is defeated, the player earns money or points, which are used to buy or upgrade towers, or upgrade the number of money or points that are earned, or even upgrade the rate at which they upgrade.the choice and positioning of the personal towers is the essential strategy of the game. many games, such as flash element tower defense, feature enemies that run through a "maze", which allows the player to strategically place towers for optimal effectiveness. however, some versions of the genre force the user to create the maze out of their own towers, such as desktop tower defense. some versions are a hybrid of these two types, with preset paths that can be modified to some extent by tower placement, or towers that can be modified by path placement.</description>

        <name>shoot 'em up</name>
        <description>shoot 'em up (also known as shmup or stg) is a subgenre of the shooter genre of video games.in a shoot 'em up, the player character engages in a lone assault, often in a spacecraft or aircraft, shooting large numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks. there is no consensus as to which design elements compose a shoot 'em up.[citation needed] some restrict the definition to games featuring spacecraft and certain types of character movement; others allow a broader definition including characters on foot and a variety of perspectives. shoot 'em ups call for fast reactions and for the player to memorise levels and enemy attack patterns. "bullet hell" games feature overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles.the genre's origins can be traced back to spacewar!, one of the very earliest computer games, developed in 1961 and eventually released in amusement arcades in the early 1970s. however, tomohiro nishikado, creator of space invaders, is generally credited with inventing the genre. space invaders premiered in japanese arcades in 1978. shoot 'em ups were popular throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. in the mid-1990s, shoot 'em ups became a niche genre based on design conventions established in the 1980s, and increasingly catered to specialist enthusiasts, particularly in japan.</description>

        <name>side-scrolling video game</name>
        <description>a side-scrolling game or side-scroller is a video game in which the gameplay action is viewed from a side-view camera angle, and the onscreen characters generally move from the left side of the screen to the right (or less commonly, right to left) to meet an objective. these games make use of scrolling computer display technology. the move from single-screen or flip-screen graphics to scrolling graphics, during the golden age of video arcade games and during third-generation consoles, would prove to be a pivotal leap in game design, comparable to the move to 3d graphics during the fifth generation.</description>

        <name>association football</name>
        <description>association football, commonly known as football or soccer, is a sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. it is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries, making it the world's most popular sport. the game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. the object of the game is to score by using any part of the body besides the arms and hands to get the ball into the opposing goal.the goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play and then only in their penalty area. outfield players mostly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may use their head or torso to strike the ball instead. the team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. if the score is tied at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time and/or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition. the laws of the game were originally codified in england by the football association in 1863. association football is governed internationally by the international federation of association football (fifa; french: fédération internationale de football association) which organises a world cup every four years.</description>

        <description>a sports game is a video game that simulates the practice of traditional sports. most sports have been recreated with a game, including team sports, athletics and extreme sports. some games emphasize actually playing the sport (such as the madden nfl series), whilst others emphasize strategy and organization (such as championship manager and out of the park baseball). some, such as need for speed, arch rivals and punch-out!!, satirize the sport for comic effect. this genre has been popular throughout the history of video games and is competitive, just like real-world sports. a number of game series feature the names and characteristics of real teams and players, and are updated annually to reflect real-world changes.</description>
